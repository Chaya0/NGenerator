# Enhanced Functional Requirements

## 1. Application Generation

### 1.1 Generate Spring Boot Application
- Allow users to generate a Spring Boot application from an XML model by loading the XML model, parsing it to extract entities, relationships, validations, and enumerations, and generating repositories, services, and controllers for each entity.
- Support generation for both monolithic and microservice architectures based on user preferences in the XML model.

### 1.2 Customize Generated Code
- Enable developers to customize the generated code so that custom code is preserved and not overwritten during regeneration.
- Allow selective regeneration of only certain layers (e.g., regenerate controllers without affecting services).
- Allow the generated project to be opened in their preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

### 1.3 Generate Frontend Components
- Allow the generation of frontend components based on the XML model.
- Add support for popular frontend frameworks like Vue.js and Svelte alongside Angular, React, and Vaadin.

### 1.4 Multi-Module Generation
- Add support for generating multi-module Spring Boot projects with separate modules for domain, service, web, and data layers.

## 2. Data Management

### 2.1 Database Schema Generation
- Generate the database schema based on the entities and their relationships defined in the XML model.
- Support multiple database types such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle by allowing users to configure the database in the XML model.
- Include support for complex relationships such as many-to-many with additional attributes and database-level constraints like unique constraints.

### 2.2 XML Model Parsing
- Parse the XML model to extract relevant data, validate the XML structure, and extract relationships between entities.
- Add support for version control on XML models, allowing users to track changes and generate different versions of the application.
- Add support for YAML and JSON as an alternative to XML for model definitions.

### 2.3 Data Migration
- Generate data migration scripts (Liquibase/Flyway) based on changes in the XML model, allowing for automatic schema evolution.

## 3. Code Generation

### 3.1 Repository Layer Generation
- Generate repository interfaces and implementations for each entity.
- Add support for generating repository code for both SQL and NoSQL databases.
-  Support dynamic query generation using Spring Data Specifications or QueryDSL.

### 3.2 Service Layer Generation
- Generate services for each entity.
- Add support for generating event-driven services (e.g., using Kafka or RabbitMQ) for complex microservice architectures.

### 3.3 Controller Layer Generation
- Generate REST controllers for each entity.
- Add support for generating GraphQL controllers alongside REST endpoints.
- Include role-based access control (RBAC) in the controller layer, generating endpoints with access restrictions based on roles defined in the XML model.

## 4. Frontend Generation

### 4.1 Angular Component Generation
- Generate Angular components, services, and modules based on the XML model.

### 4.2 React Component Generation
- Generate React components, hooks, contexts, and state management based on the XML model.

### 4.3 Vaadin Component Generation
- Generate Vaadin components, views, forms, and grids based on the XML model.

### 4.4 UI Framework Integration
- Add support for generating components using popular UI libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material Design, or Ant Design, depending on the userâ€™s preference.

## 5. Custom Code Preservation
- Provide a configuration file to specify which parts of the code can be regenerated and which should always remain untouched.

### 5.1 Preserve Custom Repository Code
- Preserve custom repository code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.
- Automatically generate hooks for custom queries that developers can fill without modifying generated code.

### 5.2 Preserve Custom Service Code
- Preserve custom service code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.

### 5.3 Preserve Custom Controller Code
- Preserve custom controller code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.

## 6. Microservice Architecture Enhancements

### 6.1 Service Discovery
- Implement service discovery for services to locate and communicate with each other without prior knowledge of network topology.

### 6.2 Load Balancing
- Integrate load balancing mechanisms for incoming requests.

### 6.3 Fault Tolerance
- Enhance microservices with fault tolerance mechanisms.

### 6.4 Service Monitoring
- Integrate monitoring and metrics collection.

### 6.5 API Gateway
- Introduce an API gateway for security and routing purposes.

### 6.6 Event-Driven Architecture
- Support event-driven architectures for asynchronous communication between microservices.

### 6.7 Container Orchestration
- Implement container orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.

### 6.8 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Define and manage infrastructure resources using IaC.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 User Guide
- Provide a comprehensive user guide for the application.

### 7.2 API Documentation
- Automatically generate API documentation for the generated code.
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST and GraphQL introspection for GraphQL APIs.

## 8. Testing and Validation

### 8.1 Automated Testing
- Implement automated tests for generated code.
- Generate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using popular frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, Cypress, and Jest.

### 8.2 Manual Testing
- Provide instructions for manual testing.

## 9. Security Features

### 9.1 Authentication and Authorization
- Automatically generate authentication and authorization mechanisms for both frontend and backend, including support for OAuth2, JWT, and OpenID Connect.
- Provide role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-tenant support in the generated code.

### 9.2 Input Validation
- Automatically generate input validation both on the frontend and backend to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## 10. Future Enhancements

### 10.1 Pluggable Architectures
- Add support for a pluggable architecture, allowing users to extend the generator with their own modules for custom code generation.

### 10.2 Advanced Frontend Customization
- Enable users to specify advanced frontend layouts, components, and styling in the XML model.

### 10.3 Library Mode
- Implement the application as a library with APIs for code generation, enabling integration into CI/CD pipelines.

### 10.4 Annotation-Based Code Generation
- Add support for generating custom annotations and using annotation processors to dynamically generate code at compile time.
