# Functional Requirements

## 1. Application Generation

### 1.1 Generate Spring Boot Application
Allow users to generate a Spring Boot application from an XML model by loading the XML model, parsing the XML model to extract entities and relationships, and generating repositories, services, and controllers for each entity.

### 1.2 Customize Generated Code
Enable developers to customize the generated code so that custom code is preserved and not overwritten during regeneration, and allow the generated project to be opened in their preferred IDE.

### 1.3 Generate Frontend Components
Allow the generation of frontend components based on the XML model by specifying frontend components in the XML model, parsing specifications, and generating Angular, React, and Vaadin components.

## 2. Data Management

### 2.1 Database Schema Generation
Generate the database schema based on the entities defined in the XML model by parsing and validating entities, generating JPA entities, and using JPA to automatically create database tables.

### 2.2 XML Model Parsing
Parse the XML model to extract relevant data by validating the XML structure and extracting relationships between entities.

## 3. Code Generation

### 3.1 Repository Layer Generation
Generate repository interfaces and implementations for each entity by creating generic and custom repository interfaces.

### 3.2 Service Layer Generation
Generate services for each entity by creating generic and custom service classes.

### 3.3 Controller Layer Generation
Generate REST controllers for each entity by creating generic and custom controller classes.

## 4. Frontend Generation

### 4.1 Angular Component Generation
Generate Angular components based on the XML model by parsing specifications and generating modules, components, and services.

### 4.2 React Component Generation
Generate React components based on the XML model by parsing specifications and generating components, hooks, contexts, and state management.

### 4.3 Vaadin Component Generation
Generate Vaadin components based on the XML model by parsing specifications and generating views, forms, and grids.

## 5. Custom Code Preservation

### 5.1 Preserve Custom Repository Code
Preserve custom repository code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.

### 5.2 Preserve Custom Service Code
Preserve custom service code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.

### 5.3 Preserve Custom Controller Code
Preserve custom controller code by detecting and saving it during regeneration.

## 6. Microservice Architecture Enhancements

### 6.1 Service Discovery
Implement service discovery to allow services to locate and communicate with each other without prior knowledge of network topology.

#### 6.1.1 Registration and Lookup
Automatically register services with a service registry and enable service lookup based on service identifiers.

### 6.2 Load Balancing
Integrate load balancing mechanisms to evenly distribute incoming requests across multiple service instances for improved scalability.

#### 6.2.1 Dynamic Scaling
Implement auto-scaling capabilities to adjust the number of service instances dynamically based on workload demand.

### 6.3 Fault Tolerance
Enhance microservices resilience with fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures gracefully and ensure system availability.

#### 6.3.1 Circuit Breaker Pattern
Implement the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures by temporarily halting requests to failing services.

### 6.4 Service Monitoring
Integrate monitoring and metrics collection to gain insights into microservices' health and performance.

#### 6.4.1 Metrics Collection
Collect metrics such as response times and error rates from services to monitor their performance.

### 6.5 API Gateway
Introduce an API gateway to act as a single entry point for client requests and provide security features.

#### 6.5.1 Request Routing
Configure the API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice based on predefined rules.

### 6.6 Event-Driven Architecture
Adopt an event-driven approach to enable asynchronous communication between microservices.

#### 6.6.1 Message Brokers
Integrate message brokers to facilitate event-based communication and reliable message delivery.

### 6.7 Container Orchestration
Implement container orchestration platforms for automated deployment and management of microservices.

#### 6.7.1 Deployment Automation
Automate microservices deployment and streamline release management using container orchestration tools.

### 6.8 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Define and manage infrastructure resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

#### 6.8.1 Configuration Management
Use IaC tools to provision infrastructure resources like virtual machines and networking components.

## 7. Documentation

### 7.1 User Guide
Provide a comprehensive user guide for the application, including installation and usage instructions.

### 7.2 API Documentation
Provide API documentation for the generated code by automatically generating API documents and allowing custom documentation.

## 8. Testing and Validation

### 8.1 Automated Testing
Implement automated tests for the generated code, including unit and integration tests.

### 8.2 Manual Testing
Provide instructions for manual testing of the generated code, including a testing guide and feedback collection.

## 9. Future Enhancements

### 9.1 User Interface
Further enhance the web-based user interface to include advanced features like drag-and-drop component placement, real-time previews, and more detailed configuration options.

### 9.2 Advanced Frontend Customization
Enable detailed frontend customization in the XML model by specifying UI components and layouts.

### 9.3 Library Mode
Implement the application as a library that can be used within other projects by exposing an API for code generation and integration with build tools.

### 9.4 Annotation-Based Code Generation
Generate code based on Java annotations by defining annotations and implementing logic for processing them.
