# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance

The generated backend must be performant and capable of handling concurrent requests efficiently.
The system should support lazy loading in the service and repository layers to optimize database access.

## Scalability

The architecture must allow horizontal scalability by breaking down the application into independent services. Each service should handle a specific business domain (e.g., user service, product service) and should be able to scale independently.
The system must also support a traditional monolithic architecture, where all components (UI, business logic, and data access layers) are part of a single deployable unit. While monoliths can scale vertically (increasing resources such as CPU, RAM), the system must allow for scaling through load balancing and optimizing performance.
The system should offer flexibility to generate either monolithic or microservices architecture based on user preference during the generation phase. The generator should provide configurations that support both.


## Security

The generated application must follow industry security standards, including data encryption, secure authentication, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, XSS).
Tokens or session cookies used for authentication must be HTTP-only and secured (e.g., using HTTPS).

## Code Quality

Generated code must be clean, maintainable, and follow common design patterns (e.g., MVC).
The code should adhere to standard Java and JavaScript/TypeScript conventions.

## Usability

The frontend must be user-friendly and intuitive, with a simple UI/UX for managing data and interacting with the backend.
All user actions (e.g., form submissions) should result in clear feedback, either via success messages or error handling.

## Extensibility

The generated code must be easily extensible, allowing developers to add new features, modify existing ones, or integrate third-party libraries.
Developers should be able to generate specific components that can later be modified and maintained without conflicts with generated code.

## Maintainability

The project structure must follow best practices, with clear separation of concerns across layers (client, controller, service, repository).
Generated files must be organized logically, enabling easy navigation and maintenance.

## Reliability

The system must generate functional applications that can be deployed and run without manual intervention.
The system must generate test files (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure reliability and consistency of the application.
