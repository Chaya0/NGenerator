# Generated Application Structure

This document describes the structure of the application generated by our generator tool. The architecture follows a layered approach, ensuring a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to manage, extend, and test.

## Overview

The application is divided into the following layers:

1. **Client**
2. **Controller (Service Layer)**
3. **Service (Business Layer)**
4. **Repository (Persistence Layer)**
5. **Database**

Each layer serves a distinct purpose within the application, and the interaction between these layers ensures a smooth flow of data from the user interface to the database and back.

## Detailed Structure

### 1. Client
The client represents the user interface, which interacts with the backend services. This could be a frontend framework like Angular, React, or Vue.js. The frontend is generated with automatic communication setup to seamlessly interact with the generated backend.

### 2. Controller (Service Layer)
The Controller layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests from the client. It acts as the intermediary between the client and the service layer. The controller processes incoming requests, invokes the appropriate service methods, and returns responses.

- **Basic Controller:** The basic controller provides fundamental operations, such as CRUD functionalities, which are common across various entities.
- **Generic Controller:** The generic controller extends the basic controller, providing additional functionalities and handling more complex use cases.

### 3. Service (Business Layer)
The Service layer contains the business logic of the application. It orchestrates the workflow between the controller and the repository layers, ensuring that business rules are applied consistently.

- **Basic Service:** The basic service provides core business operations, ensuring that the essential rules are applied consistently across different use cases.
- **Generic Service:** The generic service extends the basic service, enabling more complex business operations and allowing customization based on specific requirements.

### 4. Repository (Persistence Layer)
The Repository layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It abstracts the data access operations and provides a clean API for the service layer to retrieve and manipulate data.

- **Basic Repository:** The basic repository handles the fundamental data access operations, such as saving, deleting, and retrieving entities.
- **Generic Repository:** The generic repository extends the basic repository, adding support for more complex queries and custom data access patterns.

### 5. Database
The database is where all the application data is stored. The repository layer interacts directly with the database to perform CRUD operations, ensuring data persistence.

## Flow of Data

1. The **Client** sends a request to the **Controller**.
2. The **Controller** processes the request and interacts with the **Service** layer.
3. The **Service** layer applies business logic and, if necessary, interacts with the **Repository** layer to retrieve or persist data.
4. The **Repository** layer communicates with the **Database** to perform the necessary operations.
5. The result is passed back up through the layers to the **Client**.

This layered architecture ensures that the application is scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend. The separation of concerns allows developers to work on different parts of the application independently without affecting other layers.
