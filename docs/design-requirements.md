# Design Requirements

## Layered Architecture

The generated application must follow a multi-layered architecture (e.g., Client > Controller > Service > Repository > Database).
Each layer must have a clearly defined role, with minimal overlap between layers.

## Separation of Concerns

Code for business logic, data access, and API handling must be clearly separated into different classes and packages.
The frontend and backend must interact through well-defined APIs to minimize coupling.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Java (Spring Boot) with JPA/Hibernate for persistence.
- Frontend: Angular, React, or Vue.js (configurable during generation).
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other relational databases.
- Reports: JasperReports integration using JRXML templates.
- Versioning System

The system must support different versions of writers to generate various architectures or code styles (e.g., annotation-based configurations).
Version control must ensure compatibility between generated versions and allow backward compatibility with older versions.

## Responsive Frontend Design

The generated frontend must be responsive, ensuring proper display and interaction on various screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
The design should use a component-based approach to make the UI modular and reusable.

## Testing

The generator must produce both unit tests and integration tests for the backend services.
A 90% code coverage target should be met for generated classes, especially for service and controller layers.

## Code Formatting

The generated code should be formatted according to common style guides for both Java (backend) and TypeScript/JavaScript (frontend).
The generator must support customizable code formatting for both frontend and backend to allow for differences in spacing, indentation, etc.

## Internationalization (i18n)

The generated frontend must support internationalization (i18n), allowing text in the UI to be easily translated into different languages.

## Frontend and Backend Communication

The communication between the frontend and backend must be RESTful, using JSON as the primary data exchange format.
The frontend should include an Angular/React/Vue service that handles HTTP communication with the backend.
