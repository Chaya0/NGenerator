# Spring Boot Application Generator

The Generator Spring Boot Application is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of generating Spring Boot applications based on a data model. It allows developers to quickly scaffold Spring Boot projects with CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, and other essential components, saving time and effort in application development.

## Features

- **Automated Code Generation**: The generator automates the process of creating Spring Boot applications based on a provided data model, eliminating the need for manual coding.
- **Support for Data Models**: Developers can define their data models using XML files, specifying entities, attributes, relationships, and other necessary details.
- **CRUD Operations**: The generated applications come with built-in support for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity defined in the data model.
- **RESTful APIs**: RESTful APIs are automatically generated for interacting with the application, providing seamless integration with frontend or external systems.
- **Customization Options**: Developers have the flexibility to customize the generated code to suit their specific requirements, including modifying templates, adding additional functionality, or integrating third-party libraries.
- **Integration with Frontend Frameworks**: The generator can be extended to support integration with frontend frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js, enabling full-stack application development.

## Usage

To use the Generator Spring Boot Application, follow these steps:

1. **Define Data Model**: Create an XML file defining the data model for your application. Specify entities, attributes, relationships, and any other necessary details.
2. **Define Application Properties**: Create an application.properties file and defining the properties for application that will be generated (Spring Boot version, project path, dependencies, database informations,...)
3. **Run the Generator**: Execute the generator application, providing the path to the XML data model file as input.
4. **Customize (Optional)**: Optionally, customize the generated code to add additional functionality or modify existing templates to meet specific requirements.
5. **Build and Run**: Build the generated Spring Boot application using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) and run it locally or deploy it to a server.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven or Gradle (for building the generated Spring Boot application)
